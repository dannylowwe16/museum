<h3>"Friendly staff and amazing exhibitions. The two hours I had were not enough to cover the whole museum. Nice videos and interactive content in the Earth Hall. Makes you thinkâ€¦ which is one of the points of visiting a museum."<br>- Milen.</h3>
<h3>"Good value, plenty to see and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Make sure to leave a few hours for you visit to get a chance to see all the exhibits."<br> - Andrew</h3>
<h3>"System worked fine. I had trouble finding my tickects to download, but the hopeful folks at the ticket desk found them for me."</h3>
